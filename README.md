# sinnaj-r's JS-Config-Files

### Welcome,
You are looking at some of my most frequently used config files for js development. While I collect them here mostly for my own usage, you are welcome to adapt them to your needs. But be warned, they could be outdated or have some flaws.

If you find any of these flaws or have some ideas for improvement, I'm allways happy to see an issue or PR.
